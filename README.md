# BrandSync 🎨

**AI-powered brand consistency checker for Adobe Express**

Stop worrying about using the wrong client's colors. BrandSync watches your designs in real-time and catches brand mistakes before they happen.

## 🚀 The Problem

Freelancers and agencies juggling multiple clients face a constant struggle:
- Accidentally using Client A's blue (#3A5FFF) when designing for Client B
- Forgetting which fonts belong to which brand
- Manually cross-checking style guides while designing
- Brand inconsistencies that damage client trust

**73% of brands report visual identity inconsistencies** - and it's costing them money.

## ✨ The Solution

BrandSync is an AI assistant that lives inside Adobe Express and enforces brand guidelines automatically:

1. Upload your client's brand guidelines (PDF, images, or paste their brand kit)
2. BrandSync learns that brand's visual rules
3. Start designing - it watches in the background
4. Get instant alerts: *"This blue doesn't match Client A's palette - did you mean #2E5BFF?"*
5. Click to fix instantly
6. Learn from your approved designs over time
